        <h1 style="color:dodgerblue">About me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a graduate developer with a masterâ€™s degree in climate change sciences from the University of Bristol and a 2.1 undergraduate degree in geographical sciences from the Free University of Brussels.
            After living for 21 years in Belgium, I moved to England in 2017 to pursue my studies and career, I am currently based in Bristol.
            I have work experience in various fields such as weather forecasting, brand marketing and fundraising for communities.
            I have also volunteered for conserving the environment and I have taken part in projects at the university to promote sustainable activities.
            I am a competitive person keen on sport, more particularly athletics and karate.
            My career aim is to use my skills in climate sciences and programming to help in the development of technologies to tackle climate change.
