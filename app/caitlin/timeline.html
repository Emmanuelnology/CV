                    <li> During my first year at Durham, I studied
                    Maths and Physics as a joint honours degree,
                    and transferred to straight Maths at the
                    beginning of my second year. This enabled
                    me to choose more interesting and specialised
                    modules. </li>

                    <li> After graduating I worked as a waitress in a local
                        pub. This reinforced my customer service skills,
                        and developed my ability to keep my mind focused
                        on many things at once. </li>

                    <li> I worked in a dynamic food factory (Bar
                        Foods), that manufactures ready meals and sauces
                        for high street restaurants. I mainly worked in
                        the operations office, where I learnt to use
                        Excel VBA. A significant part of the job was
                        writing code for the planning processes, working
                        to make the complex weekly production plan
                        quicker and more efficient, as well as editing
                        old code to significantly reduce the program
                        running times. </li>

                    <li> During my A levels I had a part time job working
                        directly with customers where I learned the importance
                        of customer service and time management, as well as
                        having to think and act quickly when problems arose. </li>
