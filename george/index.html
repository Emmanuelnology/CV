            <!-- About me  -->
            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm a Computer Science student at Lancaster University (top 10 of all UK universities - Guardian/Complete University guide). But there's so much more to me than that.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With a passion for youth work, politics and actively making the world a better place, I'm not just a typical student. I've travelled up and down the country working on various projects helping young people get their voices heard in heart of politics and helping develop their skills to make them more employable. </p>

                <u><p><b>National Citizen Service - Team leader</b></u>
                    <p>Having applied for the role of assistant team leader I was asked to take a promotion to the role of a team leader for a group of 14 young people through a 4 week course of team building challenges and community engagement.
                    <p>This has been one of the most challenging jobs I've ever done but without doubt one of the most rewarding. Being responsible for the safety of 14 young people and keeping them motivated was a challenge that taught me a vast amount about leadership and the importance of relying upon your team around you.

                    <u><p><b>H & Co Design ltd - Work experience web developer</b></u>
                    <p>Working at H & Co Design Ltd, I was provided with the opportunity to develop and apply the skills I learned in website development and how to perform these to an industry standard. Furthermore I learned a great deal about eCommerce, SEO, creating responsive websites and graphic design.
                    <p>Initially I was only required to be there for 5 days, however I stayed on for longer since I found I really loved what I was doing and I was benefiting the company by being there. The technical director was pleased with the work I contributed and described me as “a quick learner, energetic and hard working” and that I would be “as great an asset to your company as he has been to ours”.

                    <u><p><b>The Willow Tree - Assistant Chef/Kitchen porter</b></u>
                    <p>I started off as a kitchen porter in September and was working 4 nights a week. It was usually just myself and the chef in the kitchen, after hiring another kitchen porter I was promoted to assistant chef (about 5/6 months after I started), where I would be responsible for cooking and setting up the starter dishes. I would also be required to help Chef with the main dishes and deserts, but I wasn't solely responsible for these.
