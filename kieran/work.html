                <h2>Projects</h2>
                    <h3>Antihydrogen at CERN</h3>For my MPhys dissertation I spent a semester working with the ALPHA collaboration at CERN in
                    Geneva. ALPHA study the matter – antimatter asymmetry problem by for example, looking at the 1S2S
                    transition in antihydrogen and comparing it to the hydrogen equivalent. A 243nm laser is used to
                    excite antihydrogen from the 1S energy state to the 2S energy state, where the energy difference can
                    be studied. My job was to measure and aid with improvements in the linewidth of this laser so that
                    this energy difference can be known to a greater precision.
                    
                    <h3>Faulkes Telescope Project</h3>I utilized numerous robotic telescopes across the world for an observation and analyzation program
                    I developed for sky objects, enhancing my writing and data gathering abilities. The process involved
                    <ul>
                        <li>Scheduling observation slots weeks in advance based on the telescope location, sky object
                            coordinates, aperture size</li>
                            <li>Rescheduling under pressure when factors such as the weather reducing visibility prevented
                                the image being taken</li>
                                <li>Analysing characteristics from successful images to determine properties of the objects</li>
                                <li>Producing a journal and presenting a poster upon the drawn conclusion of the project</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>IT Skills</h3>I have used the programming language Python for the past two years, and in this time I have gained
                            the ability to
                            <ul>
                                <li>Solve mathematical and physical tasks</li>
                                <li>Find solutions to problems of a quantitative and analytic nature</li>
                                <li>Apply abstract formalism to real world problems</li>
                                <li>Employed Monte Carlo calculations along with various other methods to solve problems in
                                    statistical and quantum physics, including the Gaussian model, harmonic oscillators and
                                    anharmonic oscillators</li>
                                </ul>
                                I have also used Microsoft Office extensively through my degree and used SQL to search the SDSS
                                archive for study on galactic evolution.
                                
                                Spectroscopy - I participated in a group project within which we built a spectrometer from common household
                                objects and presented our research, theory, method and end result. Through this I acquired an
                                improved set of presentation, leadership, research and teamwork skills.

                    <h3>Volunteer (Frontier) - Umphang Thailand (2017)</h3>
                    During my time travelling around Asia I spent a month at an elephant sanctuary located within
                    Thailand’s rainforest. Here I assisted in collecting food, feeding and bathing the elephants. On top of
                    this I supported the permanent residents in cleaning the housing and preparing food.
