                    <li> During my first year at Durham, I studied 
                    Maths and Physics as a joint honours degree, 
                    and transferred to straight Maths at the 
                    beginning of my second year. This enabled 
                    me to choose more interesting and specialised 
                    modules. </li>

            <p class="italic"> Front of house staff, September - October 2018 </p>
            <p> After graduating I worked as a waitress in a local 
                pub. This reinforced my customer service skills,
                and developed my ability to keep my mind focused
                on many things at once. </p>

            <p class="italic"> Summer internship, July - September 2017 </p>
            <p> I worked in a dynamic food factory (Bar 
                Foods), that manufactures ready meals and sauces 
                for high street restaurants. I mainly worked in 
                the operations office, where I learnt to use 
                Excel VBA. A significant part of the job was 
                writing code for the planning processes, working 
                to make the complex weekly production plan 
                quicker and more efficient, as well as editing 
                old code to significantly reduce the program 
                running times. </p>

            <p class="italic"> Customer services, October 2013 â€“ March 2015 </p>
            <p> During my A levels I had a part time job working 
                directly with customers where I learned the importance 
                of customer service and time management, as well as 
                having to think and act quickly when problems arose. </p>
