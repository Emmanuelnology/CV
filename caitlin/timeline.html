                                <li> During my first year at Durham, I studied 
                                Maths and Physics as a joint honours degree, 
                                and transferred to straight Maths at the 
                                beginning of my second year. This enabled 
                                me to choose more interesting and specialised 
                                modules. </li>

                                    and dedication to the subject, and the Oldfield

                                    pub. This reinforced my customer service skills,
                                    and developed my ability to keep my mind focused

                                    <li> I worked in a dynamic food factory (Bar

                                        for high street restaurants. I mainly worked in 
                                        the operations office, where I learnt to use 
                                        Excel VBA. A significant part of the job was 
                                        writing code for the planning processes, working 
                                        to make the complex weekly production plan 
                                        quicker and more efficient, as well as editing 
                                        old code to significantly reduce the program 
                                        running times. </li>

                                        having to think and act quickly when problems arose. </li>
